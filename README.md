A small tool with a huge workflow impact!
With Editor History installed you can navigate back and forth through your selection history with the back/forward buttons on your mouse!
The selection history can also be navigated through its own window by clicking the Editor History button in the Unity toolbar.

By default this window acts as a modal that will close if you click away from it, but in the top right corner of the window you can pop it out into a seperate window that can be docked anywhere, should you want to keep it open permanently.
